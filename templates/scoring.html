<p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Our team rate each brand from 1-5 at each of the lifecycle stages. We then calculate the average of these numbers to find the total score. Each score is then rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>Our ratings are:</p>
<p><u><b>5 Excellent</b></u></p>
<p>Very high level of supply chain transparency. Excellent ethical and environmental standards.</p>
<p><u><b>4 Good</b></u></p>
<p>High level of supply chain transparency. Good ethical and environmental standards.</p>
<p><u><b>3 Average</b></u></p>
<p>Some effort towards supply chain transparency. Room for improvement in ethical and environmental standards.</p>
<p><u><b>2 Unsatisfactory</b></u></p>
<p>Insufficient evidence found. Poor ethical and environmental standards.</p>
<p><u><b>1 Poor</b></u></p>
<p>No evidence found. Very poor ethical and environmental standards.</p>
<p>Our ratings are based primarily on public information though we endeavor to work with brands to fill any gaps. We provide scores for brands as a whole rather than individual products, so results may vary. We also score using the best of our researcher's knowledge at the time of writing but scores will be subject to future review and updates.</p>

<h3 class="h_section">Blurb</h3>
<p>**Browse beyond size and style** Transparency is crucial when it comes to ethical and sustainable business. We know that trying to find a shoe that aligns with your values can be frustrating and time consuming. With so much jargon, greenwashing, and information it can take you hours to wade through and compare brands. And when you finally order that perfect pair you panic over whether you’ve made the right choice after all. Trust us, we’ve been on those 3am spirals too. Knowing this, we created our ethics and sustainability framework to provide accessible information on brand standards to help you make informed purchase decisions. And so that all the information you need is finally in one place. Now you can browse and compare shoes based not only on size and style but by their sustainability efforts too! Our framework is constantly evolving and we review and update it regularly to maintain the ease and accuracy of finding the right pair of sustainable shoes for you. Currently, our framework doesn’t extend to our refurbished second-hand shoes but we are working on it!</p>
<h3 class="h_section">Notice</h3>
<p>For refurbished products (P1), their scores can be ignored for now as the current Sustainability Framework only supports scoring new products (P2).</p>
